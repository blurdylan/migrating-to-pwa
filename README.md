# La Nyama PWA

These are the resource files needed for the Your First Progressive Web App codelab.

In this codelab, you'll build a weather web app using Progressive Web App techniques. Your app will:

- Use responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
- Be fast & reliable, using a service worker to precache the app resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run, and cache the assets at runtime to improve performance.
- Be installable, using a web app manifest.

## What you'll learn

1. Making your app responsive
2. Creating a web app manifest for identification
3. Providing a minimal offline experience
4. Make your app installable on devices.

## Getting started

1. Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/blurdylan/la-nyama-pwa`
